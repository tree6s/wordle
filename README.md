# Word Guessing Solver

This project contains a Python program that attempts to solve word guessing puzzles using dynamic feedback and optimization strategies. It includes a solver for a Wordle-style game that can efficiently determine the correct word using an API and predefined strategies.

## Features

- Random word generation with configurable length.
- API-based guessing mechanism with retry and delay support.
- Feedback-based guessing strategy using dynamic constraints.
- Example predefined word lists for testing and optimization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- External dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python game.py
   ```
